### Data analysis pipeline to estimate risk metrics

The tcpl package now has three Rmd files as vignettes which can allow for user interaction with or without a MySQL connection. The pipeline has 6 levels of processing.

The committed changes in the csv directory show examples of input flat files as an alternative for a MySQL database. I split the original vignette in Rmarkdown format into three sections for an easier user experience:

Introduction:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/vignettes/Introduction_Appendices.html

Data processing:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/vignettes/Data_processing.html

Data retrieval:
https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tcpl/vignettes/Data_retrieval.html
