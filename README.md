### Data analysis pipeline to estimate risk metrics

The tcpl package now has three Rmd files as vignettes which can allow for user interaction with or without a MySQL connection. The pipeline has 6 levels of processing.

I committed changes in the csv directory to show examples of input flat files as an alternative for a MySQL database. I split the original vignette in Rmarkdown format into three sections for an easier user experience.
